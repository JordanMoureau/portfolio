# Jordans Portfolio and Resume
## A website that shows my skill level as a developer, displays the projects I've built and my scope as a designer. I've cram packed a lot of interactivity and flashy do jobers into this site, mainly to show what I can do, the kinds of problems I can tackle at my current skill level. Some things took more time to sort through than others, but over all this site got through the design and production process in record time considering it was built along side a full-time job and a heavy course load. Hashtag Caffinated.
